#Info
This Session indicator was made just because on [elementary OS](http://elementaryos.org) isis pre-alpha, which is based on ubuntu 13.10, the old session indicator isn't working and typing 'sudo shutdown now' is too much work ;)

#To build & run

clone the repo and do

    $ make
    $ ./session-indicator
